- [Deployed contract](https://explorer.stxer.xyz/txid/SP673Z4BPB4R73359K9HE55F2X91V5BJTN5SXZ5T.liabtc-mint-endpoint)

Façade for [`xlink-staking`][sm] contract designed to handle the lifecycle of the `LiaBTC` rebasing token (mint, burn and rebase operations).

The `liabtc-mint-endpoint` contract acts as single `aBTC` staker within the [`xlink-staking`][sm] contract. It serves as an abstraction layer, simplifying interactions between `LiaBTC` users and the liquid staking pool management provided by the [`xlink-staking`][sm] contract, also known as XLink Staking Manager.

## Mint

The mint operation consists of two main actions:

- User transfers `aBTC` to be staked in the liquid staking pool.
- User receives `LiaBTC` tokens in exchange at a 1:1 ratio (1 `aBTC` = 1 `LiaBTC`).

When a user mints `LiaBTC`, the underlying `aBTC` is transferred to the Staking Manager, which stores the funds, tracks the liquid staking status (including shares and stake balances) and emits an event.

```

## Burn

The burn operation (or unstake) allows users to withdraw their `aBTC` from the liquid staking pool in exchange for burning `LiaBTC` tokens at a 1:1 ratio. These operations are managed by the [`liabtc-mint-registry`][r] and involve a waiting period between the burn request and the final withdrawal of `aBTC`.

### Request

User initiates the request to unstake a specific amount of `aBTC`. During this step:

- That same amount of `LiaBTC` tokens are burned from the user wallet.
- A burn request is created in the registry with a unique `request-id` and a [`PENDING`](#pending) status.
- The `aBTC` are sent from the Staking Manager to the registry, which will hold the funds until the request is either finalized or revoked.

### Finalize

Once the [`burn-delay`](#burn-delay) period (typically 1,000 Bitcoin blocks) has passed, the user or any other principal can finalize the request. On finalization:

- The corresponding `aBTC` is transferred from the registry to the requester, completing the unstaking process.
- The request status is updated to [`FINALIZED`](#finalized).

### Revoke

Burn requests can be revoked by the requester at any time before it is finalized. When revoke:

- The corresponding `aBTC` is returned to the user.
- A [`mint`](#mint) operation is executed in the same transaction, restoring the user's original amount of `LiaBTC`.
- The request status is updated to [`REVOKED`](#revoked).

## Rebase

This contract manages the `LiaBTC` token reserve through the [`rebase`](#rebase) public function. Mint and burn operations perfom a rebase every time they are executed. However, `rebase` can be called permissionlessly by any principal.

The rebasing mechanism is implemented via the "shares" concept. The `LiaBTC` reserve reperesents the value in `aBTC` of the staking shares held by the `liabtc-mint-endpoint`, as tracked by the XLink Staking Manager contract.

The staking shares held by the `liabtc-mint-endpoint` are adjusted whenever users mint or burn `LiaBTC`. Over time, the value of these shares in `aBTC` grows as accrued staking rewards are reinvested, increasing the reserve.

For a detailed overview of the `LiaBTC` liquid token, refer to the [`token-liabtc`](token-liabtc.md) contract documentation.

## Features

### Public

#### `rebase`

Updates the `LiaBTC` token reserve by recalculating its value in `aBTC` based on the staking shares held by the `liabtc-mint-endpoint` contract.

#### `mint`

Mints `LiaBTC` to the caller (defined as `sender` within the contract) in exchange for `aBTC` at a 1:1 ratio. The provided `aBTC` is staked in the XLink Staking Manager by the `liabtc-mint-endpoint` on behalf of the user.

The `message` and `signature-packs` parameters serve as inputs to the [`xlink-staking::stake`][stakef] function. They are part of the XLink liquid staking pool's reward accrual mechanism, which operates permissionlessly and relies on validators.

##### Parameters

| Name              | Type                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `amount`          | `uint`                                                                          |
| `message`         | `{ token: principal, accrued-rewards: uint, update-block: uint }`               |
| `signature-packs` | `list 100 { signer: principal, message-hash: (buff 32), signature: (buff 65) }` |

#### `request-burn`

Initiates the burn procedure for a certain amount of `LiaBTC`. Several actions are performed:

- `LiaBTC` amount is burned from the user wallet.
- The same amount of `aBTC` is unstaked from the `xlink-staking` contract and transferred to the `liabtc-mint-endpoint`, which then transfers it to the [`liabtc-mint-registry`][r], where it is held until finalization or revocation.
- A request with `PENDING` status is created on the registry.

As with [`mint`](#mint-1), the `message` and `signature-packs` parameters serve as inputs to the [`xlink-staking::unstake`][unstakef] function.

##### Parameters

| Name              | Type                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `amount`          | `uint`                                                                          |
| `message`         | `{ token: principal, accrued-rewards: uint, update-block: uint }`               |
| `signature-packs` | `list 100 { signer: principal, message-hash: (buff 32), signature: (buff 65) }` |

#### `revoke-burn`

Revokes a burn request. Only the requester (`requested-by` field of the request) can call this function. The registry returns the funds back to user as in `finalize-request`, with the key difference that the [`mint`](#mint-1) function is invoked (with the user as `sender`) to restake the `aBTC` and mint the `LiaBTC` back to the user. Request status is updated to `REVOKED`.

##### Parameters

| Name              | Type                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `request-id`      | `uint`                                                                          |
| `message`         | `{ token: principal, accrued-rewards: uint, update-block: uint }`               |
| `signature-packs` | `list 100 { signer: principal, message-hash: (buff 32), signature: (buff 65) }` |

#### `finalize-burn`

Finalizes a burn request by transferring the `aBTC` from the registry to the user (`requested-by` field of the request). Request is set as `FINALIZED`. This function is permissionless and can be called by any user, even those who did not initiate the burn request.

## Contract calls

- [`xlink-staking`][sm]: Interactions with the Staking Manager are present in the contract's core opertions. It is called during every mint or burn operation to handle the corresponding stake or unstake actions. Additionally, the Staking Manager is essential to perfom the `LiaBTC` rebase by retrieving the value of `aBTC` held by the `liabtc-mint-endpoint` as a staker within the protocol.

- [`liabtc-mint-registry`][r]: The registry is called to manage burn requests and handle funds during the burning/unstaking process.

- [`token-liabtc`][liabtc]: This contract is called to perform three essential actions: rebase, mint and burn.

- `'SP2XD7417HGPRTREMKF748VNEQPDRR0RMANB7X1NK.token-abtc`: As the underlying token that backs `LiaBTC`, this contract is called for transfers and to specify the token being staked in the Staking Manager.

- `'SM26NBC8SFHNW4P1Y4DFH27974P56WN86C92HPEHH.lisa-dao`: This contract is exclusively called by the [`is-dao-or-extension`](#is-dao-or-extension) function for authorizing governance operations.
