To unstake your LISA tokens, you would need to individually select which LISA tokens specifically you would like to unstake:

**LiSTX:** [**https://app.lisalab.io/li/stx/redeem**](https://app.lisalab.io/li/stx/redeem)

**LiALEX:** [**https://app.lisalab.io/li/alex/redeem**](https://app.lisalab.io/li/alex/redeem)

**LiaBTC:** [**https://app.lisalab.io/li/abtc/redeem**](https://app.lisalab.io/li/abtc/redeem)

**vLiaBTC (Bitcoin Chain):** [**https://app.lisalab.io/li/btc/redeem**](https://app.lisalab.io/li/btc/redeem)



**To stack, follow these instructions:**

1. Enter the LISA Unstacking Page listed above.
2. Connect your preferred wallet.
3. Type in the amount you'd like to Unstack.&#x20;
4. Click ‘Request Unstack’ after confirming the amount you will receive. (It will always be 1:1)
5. Approve the ‘Request-Burn’ transaction.
6. Once the transaction has completed, you will receive a Receive Mint NFT, which represents the cooldown period for your Stack Out process.\


To understand how the Request / Redemption process works in depth, please read the Stacking/Staking on LISA section.

To understand the mechanism of how the unstacking works, please read [Withdrawing from LISA](../rebasing-mechanism-101/depositing-withdrawing-from-lisa.md).

### **Selling via AMM:**&#x20;

You can skip both the In and Out cooldown cycle by buying or selling your LISA tokens via AMM: [ALEX](https://app.alexlab.co/swap) or [Bitflow](https://app.bitflow.finance/trade).

Selling via the AMM is subject to slippages and swapping fees in exchange for the convenience of time.
