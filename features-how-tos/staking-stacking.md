To start earning $STX or $ALEX reward, you need to either stack/stake or buy the liquid stacking/staking tokens via the ALEX AMM.

To stack, follow these instructions:

1. Enter the [LISA Stacking/Staking](https://app.lisalab.io/lisa) Page and pick the tokens you want to begin earning rewards.
2. Connect your preferred wallet.
3. To earn rewards for STX, click ‘Stack Now’ on the STX selection.
4. Enter the amount of STX you would like to stack and click ‘Stack’
5. Approve the ‘Request-Mint’ transaction.
6. Once the transaction has completed, you will receive a Request Mint NFT, which represents the cooldown period for your Stack In process.

To understand the mechanism of how the stacking works, please read '[Depositing into LISA](../rebasing-mechanism-101/depositing-withdrawing-from-lisa.md)'.

### Buying via AMM:&#x20;

You can skip both the In and Out cooldown cycle by buying or selling your LISA tokens via AMM: [ALEX](https://app.alexlab.co/swap) or [Bitflow](https://app.bitflow.finance/trade).

Buying via the AMM is subject to slippages and swapping fees in exchange for the convenience of time.&#x20;
